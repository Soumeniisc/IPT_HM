1> In this calculation G(\tau) is taken real(which is true). But while we are doing FFT for wn --> \tau we are only taking its real value. Our work would be to define G(\tau) complex data type instead of real and  in the calculation we should see that imaginary part of G(\tau) is become zero.

1.1> calculate extrapolation correlty to get G(\beta). its look like G(\beta) is calculated deviate for large beta. in principle G(\beta) = -0.5. like at \beta=100 it's -0.4986, DONE: G(\tau=0.0 ) calculated and checked that its giving the correct result, one no need to the extrapolation.

2> Also create seperate seperate test directory and keep the test modules and check test is sucessfull.

3> work on github to make comment on every change and push it and also branching the code for developing for anothe problem.

4> add doc directory where the relevent formula and relevent importtant things will be stored,DONE: doc direcory is creted

5> in to mot phase pade dos seems to be not coming correctly.  for beta=100 do the and check everythong coming correct
